### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Sachin Modi.

Mobile phones always fascinated me and made me curious about their functions and their various features.
As a teenager, I was the go-to person when something was wrong with any of my family member's mobile phones. That's why I decided to learn Android Development. I'm excited and looking forward to making significant contributions to the Android world and building something that'll help people.

I am also a sports enthusiast who loves to play outdoor games like Cricket, Volleyball, etc. I served as an NCC Senior Under Officer. I'm also a fitness freak.
